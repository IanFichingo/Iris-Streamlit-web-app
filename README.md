## Simple Streamlit Iris Web App
This is a simple machine learning model which is created into a web app using streamlit. This is a simple support vector machine model fit into the Iris dataset. The aim is to deploy using Heroku platform.

The aim of this project was to teach myself how to put machine learning projects into production. This is my first model to deploy.

In this repository we have the saved pickle file of the support vector machine model, the python script which builds the web app, and the python notebook.
